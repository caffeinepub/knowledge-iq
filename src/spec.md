# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive, modern landing page for “Knowledge IQ” (competitive exam prep) using a dark navy blue + saffron theme, with clear sections and basic on-page SEO.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive homepage layout with consistent typography/spacing, prominently featuring “Knowledge IQ” and references to UPSC, SSC, RRB, WBCS, PSC.
- Add a hero section with a visual (India map outline + book/target/globe/chart icons), English headline/subheadline, and two CTAs labeled exactly “Start Practice” and “Download Free PDFs” with visible hover/focus states.
- Add distinct homepage sections labeled: Daily GK, Mock Tests, Current Affairs, Previous Year Questions, Free PDFs—each with a short description and a clear action link/button.
- Implement basic SEO/accessibility: HTML title + meta description, single H1, semantic structure (header/main/section/footer), and appropriate alt text/aria for images/icons.
- Include hero artwork as static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and reference them directly from the frontend.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can open a mobile-friendly “Knowledge IQ” landing page, see a themed hero with CTAs, and navigate via clear section links for Daily GK, Mock Tests, Current Affairs, Previous Year Questions, and Free PDFs.
