  "summary": "The diff adds a new landing-page-style React app with navy/saffron theming and basic SEO tags in index.html, but it does not provide the required generated hero/image assets and (from the truncated App.tsx) there is insufficient evidence that the hero CTAs and hero artwork requirements are met. It also introduces Internet Identity/auth hooks that are explicitly out of scope.",

      "requirement": "Hero section must include a visual featuring an India map outline and four exam-prep icons (book, target, globe, chart) as part of the hero visual, plus CTA buttons labeled exactly \"Start Practice\" and \"Download Free PDFs\" with hover/focus styles.",

      "requirement": "Include generated hero artwork as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and use it in the hero section without backend fetching.",
      "reason": "No files under frontend/public/assets/generated are shown as added, and the hero implementation shown uses Lucide React icons rather than referenced generated static image assets.",
